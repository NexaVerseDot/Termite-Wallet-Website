Never share your wallet private keys (aka 12-24 word mnemonic) with anyone, including the Termite team. All potential problems with the wallet app can be addressed without the need for a wallet private key.

When contacting the Termite team regarding a problem with the wallet app, please include:

- App Status logs with the message. Sharing app status logs do not carry any risks and are mainly needed for troubleshooting the problem effectively. The logs are located in **Settings >> About App >> App Status**.

- If the problem relates to a transaction, then also include the public transaction ID, which can be located by clicking on the respective transaction on the Transactions page.
